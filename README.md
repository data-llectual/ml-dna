This repo will cover whole lot machine learning problems.

<B> Supervised Learning</B>

ML based lead generation problem attempts to find most probable features from set of features that will result leads to prospective customer.

following ml algos were analyzed 

1) Decision Tree Classifier  : Using entropy (information gain) criterion.

2) Decision Tree using Grid serach

3) Ensemble : Random Forest

4) Logistic classifier

5) Deep Neural Network with Keras and Theano
