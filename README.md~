# ml-dna

This repo will cover whole lot machine learning problems.

Problem no 1: 
Design and Develop ML based sales lead generation system.

1) DataScience-Problem.docx => This file provides detailed description of the problem.
2) DataScience-Problem-Data.csv => This file contains data to train and test ml models.
3) ml-sales-lead.ipynb  => solution for the iPython notebook that covers complete solution.
4) ML-based-lead-generation.html => solution in html format with detailed analysis of the problem.

following ml algos were analyzed : 

1) Decision Tree Classifier  : Using entropy (information gain) criterion.

2) Decision Tree using Grid serach

3) Ensemble : Random Forest

4) Logistic classifier

5) Deep Neural Network with Keras and Theano
